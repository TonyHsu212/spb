    #A job is selected (via a link) from the currentjobs page.
    # On this page services and parts can be added to a job.
    # The technician can select a part or service from existing lists (which are maintained by the Admins).
    # The technician enters the number of units of each part or service used (e.g., 2 headlights or 1 respray).
    # This page should also show the services and parts that have already been used in the job.
    # A job can also be marked as completed.
    # After a job is marked complete, the job total cost is calculated.
    # Once a job is marked complete it cannot be modified.
